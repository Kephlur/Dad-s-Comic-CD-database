# Dad-s-Comic-CD-database
A place for my dad to categorize his extensive cd collection. 
WIP

Pet Project for a local CRUD website for my dad to categorize his comics and cds. Not finished yet, but is useable.


Allows a user to login/register. 
Allows logged in and non-logged in users to view the catalogue.
Allows logged in users to delete, create, and edit comics and cd entries.
Entries are stored in a SQL server

New features are added as I have ideas or at my fathers behest.
